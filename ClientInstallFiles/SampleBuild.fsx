    You must also select (by uncommenting) one of the following options:

        A) Single project - just take multiple passes over a single project.

        B) Single Interface, Many Implementations - use a convention based approach
            to easily build a base project which contains contracts and self contained logic
            and implementations for various technologies. This pattern is useful in that enables
            many packages to reference some common contract, and the application can then just provide 
            the implementation.
